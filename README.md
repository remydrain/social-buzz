# Social Buzz Content Analysis

## Description
I started working on this analysis as part of the [Accenture North America Data Analytics and Visualization virtual experience on Forage](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/hzmoNKtzvAzXsEqx8/data-analytics-virtual-experience). I performed the initial cleaning and analysis of the data in Google Sheets, then decided to challenge myself to perform the same analysis using SQL and R. You can read about my process in the documentation [here](https://remydrain.github.io/social-buzz).
